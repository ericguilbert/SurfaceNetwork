        Constructor defining a new terrain from a raster file.
        The constructor loads the heights in an array called dtm
        and initialises other arrays: 
            pixelclass stores the morphometric class of each pixel,
            diag indicates the orientation of the diagonal, can be Â±1.
            neighbour for each pixel contains the list of neighbouring pixels according to the triangulation
            boundary is a list of pixels located at the border outside the terrain
            inbound is the list of pixels located on the inner side of the border
            maxz and minz are scalars
        The constructor is not able yet to handle holes.

            path to the file containing the raster terrain.

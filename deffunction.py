def gradLength(z, v, ldr):
    """
    gradLength returns rounded gradient norms from a point to a series of neighbouring points
    distance is 3/2 along the diagonal because we want the closest direction to gradient.
    For one triangle
    The steepest descent is a vector going from one vertex to the opposite edge. The position
    on the opposite edge has an abscissa in [0;1], 0 if the vector goes along the pixel edge p1,
    1 if it goes along the diagonal to vertex p2. If it is below Â½, the vector is closer to p1,
    if it is above, it is closer to p2. Since grad z = (z1-z0, z2-z1) if p0 is the local origin,
    the gradient will be closer to p2 if (z2-z0)>3/2(z2-z1)

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : float
        Height of the central point.
    v : float list
